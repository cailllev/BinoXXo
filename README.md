# BinoXXo
## Description
A simple BinoXXo game. Configurable size of field and "difficulty". A server serves the js scripts to the client, no server side logic.

## Usage
Currently deployed with heroku at https://gentle-refuge-74003.herokuapp.com/

## TODO
- Add button for hints (which "O"s or "X"s are wrong)
- Add button to restart round (``localStorage.clear()``)
- Write description for own deployement
- Implement logic so only one solution is possible
